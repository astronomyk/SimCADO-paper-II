\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

MICADO and the ELT will offer us the chance to finally resolve the core populations of the densest star clusters in the Milky Way and in neighbouring galaxies out to distances of a several hundred kiloparsecs. By turning MICADO towards young stellar clusters we hope to finally answer the question as to whether the IMF is indeed universal, or whether the shape of the distribution changes when we leave the Galaxy. Currently the answers are locked up inside young stellar clusters, which by nature have very high stellar densities. Observations of these clusters are primarily limited by confusion. Exactly how much of the stellar populations will be visible to MICADO is what we wanted to address with this study.

This study aimed to answer two questions: What is the lowest mass star that MICADO will be able to observe reliably for a given stellar density and distance? And what instrumental effects will play a critical role when undertaking such studies with MICADO and the ELT? In order to answer these we used the instrument simulator for MICADO (SimCADO) to generate ``observations'' of 42 dense stellar regions. These regions had stellar densities similar to what would be observed if one were to place an open cluster or a young massive cluster at various distances from Earth. Here we present a brief summary of the results:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We have shown that MICADO will easily be able to resolve stellar populations with stellar densities of 10\h3\,\spa. With proper knowledge of the PSF and an optimised detection and subtraction algorithm densities of 5$\times$10\h3\,\spa should also be achievable.

    \item Given that MICADO observations will be bound by the instrument's sensitivity to both the brightest and faintest sources in the field of view, MICADO is best suited to investigate the shape of the IMF in clusters in the outer edges of the Milky Way as well as the nearest galaxies. For real world science cases this means that the cores of dense young star clusters such as R136 in the LMC and NGC330 in the SMC will be resolvable with MICADO.
    
    \item Observations focusing on the initial mass function of clusters in the LMC will be limited by sensitivity, not crowding, to 0.1\,\msun. This means that investigations of the brown dwarf knee (\s0.08\,\msun) will not be possible outside the Milky Way, however MICADO's resolution will allow the low mass turn over region of the IMF (0.1\,\msun\textless M \textless0.5\,\msune) to be extensively investigated in the Magellanic clouds, and the high mass function out to distances of 5\,Mpc.
    
    \item The brown dwarf population will be accessible in the cores of the densest Milky Way clusters, e.g. in the Arches and Westerlund clusters. Objects with masses on the order of 10\,M$_{Jup}$ will be accessible by MICADO for clusters within 8\,kpc of Earth. The only caveat is that an appropriate observation strategy must be found to mask the many bright (m$_{Ks}<15^m$) stars in these clusters.
    
    \item Finally accurate knowledge of the ELT's PSF will be absolutely essential for good photometry and PSF subtraction algorithms. The sharp structures created by the segmented mirror design lead to many fake low luminosity star detections if either the PSF is not well known or the extraction algorithm is not capable of differentiating between a star and an artefact of the PSF.
