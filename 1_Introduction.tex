The Initial Mass Function (IMF) and its consequences are found in almost all fields of astronomy and astrophysics. It is the empirically derived mass distribution of stars produced during a star formation event. In galactic astronomy the IMF is important because it determines not only the fate of the environment surrounding a star formation region, but in the longer term also the composition of older stellar populations, and the galaxy as a whole. The relative numbers of low to high mass stars also has a huge impact on the mass cycle of a galaxy. The larger the amount of mass locked up in low mass stars, the smaller the reservoir of gas for the next generation of stars. For archeoastonomy, the IMF is a critical parameter for determining the star formation history of a galaxy. On the more theoretical side, hydrodynamic simulations of galaxies and cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters rely on the IMF to determine the strength of feedback mechanisms governing the movement of energy and material. In short the IMF is an extremely important parameter in astronomy. 
%Some may find it humorous that for all its importance,
For all its importance, the shape of the IMF is still determined empirically and its origins continue to be hotly debated. 

In his original work, \citet{salpeter1955} used a single power law distribution with a slope of 2.35 to describe the IMF for masses greater than \s1\,\msun. This was later modified to a series of broken power laws to include the stars below the hydrogen burning limit by \citet{kroupa2001}. In contrast \citet{chabrier2003} proposed a log-normal distribution with a power law modification for the high and low mass regions. As the two descriptions are very similar in the most populated region between 0.1\msun and 10\msune, it has proved very difficult to decide which model more aptly describes the IMF.

Furthermore regardless of where observers look, if appears that the shape of the IMF is constant. Each star forming region produces on average the same relative amount of stars per mass bin as any other star forming region. Conclusive deviations from the accepted IMF are elusive, yet there is one major aspect that hinders general acceptance of a universally constant IMF: a lack of stellar mass statistics for environments substantially different from the solar neighbourhood. Table \ref{tbl:imf_lit_review} shows that even in the closest star forming galaxies like the large and small Magellanic clouds, only the Hubble space telescope (HST) has the sensitivity to reach the sub-solar mass stars (See references in Table \ref{tbl:imf_lit_review}). Long exposures with HST have observed stars just below the first break in the Kroupa power law at 0.5\,\msun \citep{dario2009,kalirai2013,geha2013}, but not far enough into the lower mass regions to put constraints on the shape of the IMF in these extragalactic environments. Adding to observers' woes is the lack of spatial resolution. At the distance of the LMC, star forming regions can contain anywhere from 10\h2 to 10\h5\,\spa. A perfect example of why current studies struggle to reliably determine the IMF for dense stellar populations outside the Milky Way is given in Figure~1 of \citet{sirianni2000}. The picture shows a cluster core being completely dominated by the flux of the brightest stars. Thus studies of the IMF are limited to the outer regions of these clusters where stellar densities are low enough for individual low mass stars to be resolved. The age of a cluster and the resulting level of mass segregation can also skew the results when considering the IMF in massive clusters \citep{lim2013}. However without being able to study the core of such clusters inside and outside the Milky Way, it is difficult to determine to what extent this plays a role. Thus in order to systematically study the lower mass, and arguably most interesting, part of the IMF telescopes with higher spatial resolution and better sensitivity than the current generation of ground and space based telescope will be needed.

In the middle of the next decade, the era of the extremely large telescopes will begin. ESO's Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) \citep{eelt} with the help of advanced adaptive optics \citep{maory} will offer the power to resolve spatial scales at the diffraction limit of a 40m-class mirror. This will provide an improvement of a factor of \s15$\times$ over HST and a factor of \s6$\times$ over the future JWST telescope. With a collecting area of 978\,m\h2 the ELT will have at least the same sensitivity as the HST in sparse field and will be able to observe much deeper than HST in crowded fields. The MICADO instrument \citep{micado, micado2016} will be the ELT's first-light near-infrared (NIR) wide-field imager and long slit spectrograph. With a plate scale of 4\,mas and an AO corrected field of view of almost a square arcminute, MICADO aims to address exactly this niche. 

Determining to what extent MICADO will improve our ability to study the IMF and other properties of dense stellar populations is the main focus of this paper. In this paper we have attempted to addressed the following two questions: What is the lowest mass star that MICADO will be able to observe for a given density and distance? What instrumental effects will play a critical role when undertaking such studies with MICADO and the ELT?
In our quest for answers we used SimCADO, the instrument data simulator for MICADO \citep{leschinski2016}, to simulate a wide range of densely populated stellar fields at various distances, which can act as cluster proxies. The current version of SimCADO takes into account all the major and most of the minor spatial and spectral effects along the line of sight between the source and the detector. We used the software to generate realistic images of our model stellar fields and then conducted several iterations of PSF photometry and star subtraction to extract as many stars as possible from the simulated observations. The extracted stars were compared with the input catalogue to determine the completeness of the extraction and to define a ``limiting reliably observable mass'' for the different stellar field densities and distances.

This paper is organised in the following way: Section \ref{sec:observations} describes the stellar fields used in our simulations and how the simulations were run. In this section we also describe the algorithm for detecting and subtracting stars in the simulated images. In Section \ref{sec:results} we describe the results of the simulations and discuss their validity in the context of possible future observations of real young stellar clusters. Section \ref{sec:conclusion} summarises our results.
