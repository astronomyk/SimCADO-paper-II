- Language - British vs US English
  I would be interested to know which "americanisms" in my writing style led you to conclude that I primarily use US english. Given my Australian citizenship, I put effort into adhering to the British spelling conventions. However I do not actively check my grammar for any US influences.

  I have reinstated the british spelling of
  - neighbourhood, catalogue, colour, centre, organised

- Style - "over" vs "more than".
  I appreciate that pre-2014 "more than" was deemed correct and "over" incorrect. However since 2014 the associated press accepts both variants. I was raised using "over", so it is part of my writing style. Hence I would like to keep it, unless of course there is a specific A&A rule against this.

- Note 1 : Title
  Both Joao and I agree the title needs to begin with "The future"

    On the local scale, the IMF describes the number of massive stars that will form during a star forming event.
    This dictates both the ultimate fate of a star formation region and the environment that emergent planet-forming circumstellar disks will be exposed too.

Do you mean "the IMF determines the number of available massive stars. This number holds information about the fate of a star formation region. Massive stars create the environments..."?

    However what currently hinders a conclusive result regarding the universality of the IMF is the lack of a statistically relevant sample of directly derived IMFs in environments substantially different from the solar neighbourhood.
    - old:
    % One main challenge\LEt{this is not quite clear. The challenge is not the directly derived IMFs, but that it is difficult to obtain them, correct? Please rephrase this to reflect that, maybe like "We cannot conclude on the universality of the IMF without directly derived IMFs..." or similar} hinders a concluding result on the universality of the IMF:  directly derived IMFs from star-counts for environments that are substantially different from the solar neighborhood.

    10^2 to 10^5 stars per square arcsecond (stars arcsec^-2). Should this be written out fully?

    More importantly, without being able to study the massive clusters in- and outside the Milky Way, it is difficult to make strong assertions on the universality of the IMF.
    - new:
    More importantly, because current telescopes are unable to resolve the IMFs of massive clusters both in- and outside the Milky Way, strong assertions on the universality of the IMF are problematic.

    More precisely, we determine the lowest mass star that MICADO will be able to observe for a given density and distance.
    We also shed light on the instrumental effects that will play a critical role when such studies are undertaken with MICADO and the ELT.
    As theoretical work is always best connected to an observable quantity, we also present an estimate of the number of young clusters that will be available for IMF studies with the ELT\@ out to a distance of 5\,Mpc.

    %More precisely, we address the following three questions\LEt{direct questions in a paper are unusual. Please rephrase along the lines of "... we determine the lowest mass of a star that MICADO will be able to observe ..." The questions look too much like the work order that prompted the paper, and the paper itself should be better than an order list}:
    %1) What is the lowest mass star that MICADO will be able to observe for a given density and distance?
    %2) What instrumental effects will play a critical role when such studies are undertaken with MICADO and the ELT? and
    %3) How many young clusters will be available for IMF studies with the ELT?
