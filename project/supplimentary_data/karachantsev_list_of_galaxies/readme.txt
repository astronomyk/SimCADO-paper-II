Abstract:
    We present an all-sky catalog of 869 nearby galaxies having individual
    distance estimates within 11Mpc or corrected radial velocities
    V_LG_<600km/s. The catalog is a renewed and expanded version of the
    Catalog of Neighboring Galaxies by Karachentsev et al (2004, cat.
    J/AJ/127/2031). It collects data on the following galaxy observables:
    angular diameters, apparent magnitudes in far-UV, B, and K_s_bands,
    H{alpha} and HI fluxes, morphological types, HI-line widths, radial
    velocities, and distance estimates. In this Local Volume (LV) sample,
    108 dwarf galaxies still remain without measured radial velocities.
    The catalog yields also calculated global galaxy parameters: linear
    Holmberg diameter, absolute B magnitude, surface brightness, HI mass,
    stellar mass estimated via K-band luminosity, HI rotational velocity
    corrected for galaxy inclination, indicative mass within the Holmberg
    radius, and three kinds of "tidal index," which quantify the local
    density environment. The catalog is supplemented with data based on
    the local galaxies, which presents their optical and available
    H{alpha} images, as well as other services. We briefly discuss the
    Hubble flow within the LV and different scaling relations that
    characterize galaxy structure and global star formation in them. We
    also trace the behavior of the mean stellar mass density, HI-mass
    density, and star formation rate density within the volume considered.

Description:
    Our list of galaxies in the Local Volume (LV) consists of 869 objects.
    This catalog is a renewed and expanded version of the Catalog of
    Neighboring Galaxies (CNG) by Karachentsev et al (2004, cat.
    J/AJ/127/2031). Compiling the updated catalog of nearby galaxies, we
    generally followed the same sequence of presenting the observational
    data. Moreover, the catalog includes new parameters (H{alpha} emission
    line fluxes, far-ultraviolet fluxes) that characterize the current
    star formation activity in galaxies. In addition to this catalog, we
    created an online database located at http://www.sao.ru/lv/lvgdb,
    which accumulates both observed and calculated integral parameters of
    the galaxies, presents galaxy images, and gives numerous references to
    the sources of the observables. The structure of the LV galaxy
    database is described by Kaisina et al. (2012AstBu..67..115K). The
    list of 869 galaxies, included in the updated CNG catalog, is
    presented in Table1. We used the original observational data of nearby
    galaxies, compiled in Table1, to calculate their linear diameter,
    integral luminosity, hydrogen mass, and other global parameters. These
    characteristics are presented in Table2.

Note (1): Corresponding to the Holmberg isophote (~26.5mag/arcsec^2^)
     in B band. See text Section 3 for additional details.
Note (2): According to Schlegel et al. (1998ApJ...500..525S).
Note (3): According to data on the UV-survey performed at the Galaxy Evolution
     Explorer (GALEX; Martin et al., 2005ApJ...619L...1M, Gil de Paz et al.,
     2007, cat. J/ApJS/173/185). For 295 galaxies the asymptotic Far UltraViolet
     (FUV) magnitudes were taken from Lee et al. (2011, cat. J/ApJS/192/6) and
     are presented in Table3 without correction for Galactic extinction. For
     other galaxies, the GALEX data on the FUV-fluxes and FUV-magnitudes were
     extracted from the NASA Extragalactic Database (NED), summing fluxes from
     all structural knots within the optical galaxy image.
Note (4): Sources of which are listed in the LV database 
     (http://www.sao.ru/lv/lvgdb) as well as in Table 3. If a galaxy lacks the 
     photometric Bmag, its apparent magnitude was estimated by eye comparing 
     with images of other galaxies of similar structure with measured Bmag. In 
     such cases, as a rule for objects of low surface brightness, a typical 
     error of Bmag estimate amounts to ~0.5mag.
Note (5): As seen in the Cousins R-band. Following the approach by Fukugita et
     al. (1995PASP..107..945F), we determined it as Hamag=-2.5log(FHa)-13.64
     where FHa is the integral flux in the H{alpha} line in units of
     [erg/cm^2^/sec]. See Section 3 for additional details.
Note (6): The source of Ks data is the 2MASS Sky Survey (Jarrett et al.,
     2000AJ....119.2498J, 2003AJ....125..525J) supplemented by photometric
     measurements from Fingerhut et al. (2010ApJ...716..792F), Vaduvescu et al.
     2005AJ....130.1593V, 2006AJ....131.1318V). At the lack of accurate
     photometry, K-magnitudes were estimated by apparent magnitudes in the
     optical (B, V, R, I) or near-infrared (J, H) bands using synthetic color
     indices of galaxies from Buzzoni (2005MNRAS.361..725B) and Fukugita et al.
     (1995PASP..107..945F).
Note (7): flagged (*) galaxies have only their B magnitude, and thus the Ks 
     magnitude was determined by a relation between the average color index 
     <B-K> and morphological type (Jarrett et al., 2003AJ....125..525J): 
     <B-K> = 4.10 for early-types E, S0, Sa; 
     <B-K> = 2.35 for late-types Sm, BCD, Ir; and 
     <B-K> = 4.60-0.25T for intermediate types T=3-8 in de Vaucouleurs scale.
Note (8): Where HImag=17.4-2.5logFHI, where the integral HI-flux, FHI, is
     expressed in [Jy.km/s]. References to data sources on FHI are listed
     in the Table 3 and in the LV database (http://www.sao.ru/lv/lvgdb).
Note (9): The main source of W50 data was LEDA, as well as the HIPASS and
     ALFALFA surveys. The references to individual W50 measurements are
     presented in Table5 and the LV database (http://www.sao.ru/lv/lvgdb).
Note (10): According to the numerical classification by de Vaucouleurs et al.
     (1991, cat. VII/155). See Section 3 for additional details.
Note (11): In order to describe the morphology of dwarf galaxies in more detail,
     we introduce a two-parameter scheme, which takes into account both the 
     surface brightness of a dwarf system (Tdw column), and its color (or the 
     presence of emission; Mcl column): (Ir, Im, or BCD)-blue; 
     (Tr, dS0em, or dEem)-mixed; and (Sph, or dE)-red. This diagram is 
     schematically shown in Figure 2. See Section 3 for additional details. 
Note (12): References to them are given in Table4. As a rule, we selected
     value of HRV having the smallest measurement error.

Note (13): At the Holmberg isophote, corrected for Galactic extinction and
     inclination according to Fouque & Paturel (1985A&A...150..192F).
Note (14): vAmp=W50/2sini. Adjusted for the inclination, where the HI line
     width, W50, contains a correction for turbulent motions following
     Tully & Fouque (1985ApJS...58...67T) scheme with a parameter
     {sigma}_z_=10km/s.
Note (15): According to Verheijen (2001ApJ...563..694V):
     ABi=[1.54+2.54(log(2vAmp)-2.5)]log(a/b), if 2vAmp>78km/s, otherwise AB=0.
     Therefore, dwarf galaxies with vAmp<39km/s, as well as gas-poor E,
     S0-galaxies without W50 estimates, were considered to be fully transparent
     systems.
Note (16): Corrected for the Galactic and internal extinction.
Note (17): Within the Holmberg isophote. <Bmu> =Bmag+5log(a26)+8.63,
     where the apparent magnitude (Bmag) and angular diameter (a26) are 
     corrected for extinction and inclination.
Note (18): Corrected for extinction. K-K^c^=0.085(AB+ABi) (where
     AB is the Galactic extinction in B band, and ABi is the internal 
     B band extinction), at absolute magnitude of the Sun M_K_^{Sun}^=3.28 
     (Binney & Merrifield, eds. 1998, Galactic Astronomy, Princeton, NJ: 
     Princeton Univ. Press).
Note (19): Where the mass M26=3.31*10^4^vAmp^2^*a26*Dist, where a26 is the 
     corrected angular diameter, vAmp is the amplitude of rotational 
     velocity, and Dist is the distance to the galaxy (Roberts & Haynes, 
     1994ARA&A..32..115R).
Note (20): MHI=2.356*10^5^*Dist^2^*FHI, where FHI is the integral HI-flux 
     (Roberts & Haynes, 1994ARA&A..32..115R).
Note (21): Relative to the Local Group centroid with apex parameters
     (Karachentsev & Makarov, 1996AJ....111..794K) adopted in NED:
     Vlg=HRV+316[sin(b)*sin(-4^{deg}^)+cos(b)*cos(-4^{deg}^)*cos(l-93^{deg}^)],
     where l and b are Galactic coordinates of the galaxy.
Note (22): Determined in Section 8 via distance and mass of the nearest
     significant neighbor. Positive values of {Theta}_1_ indicate the
     membership in groups, negative values correspond to isolated galaxies.
Note (23): The main disturber is the neighboring galaxy, producing the maximal
     tidal influence on this galaxy. In fact, the set of objects in Table 2
     with the same MD and {Theta}_1_>0 corresponds to a definition of physical
     group of galaxies.
Note (24): Determined by five most important neighbors. Unlike {Theta}_1_, the
     index {Theta}_5 seems to be a more robust feature of galaxy environment.
Note (25): {Theta}_j_ is defined at the logarithm of the Ks-band luminosity
     density within 1Mpc around the galaxy, taken in units of the mean
     global K-band luminosity density derived from 2MASS catalogue (see
     2006MNRAS.369...25J).

Global notes:
Note (G1): References to the distance estimation are presented in Table6.
     Method used to obtain the distance as follows:
    TRGB = by the Tip of the Red Giant Branch;
     Cep = from the Cepheid luminosity;
    geom = by a geometric determination of the distance;
      SN = from the SuperNova luminosity;
     SBF = from galaxy Surface Brightness Fluctuations;
     mem = from galaxy membership in known groups with measured distances of
           other members;
      TF = by the Tully-Fisher relation;
      FP = by the Fundamental Plane;
      BS = by luminosity of the Brightest Stars;
     CMD = by the Color Magnitude Diagram using some prominent features or
           simultaneous distance and stellar population fitting;
      HB = by the Horizontal Branch;
      RR = from the luminosity of RR Lyrae stars;
    PNLF = by the Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function;
       h = by the Hubble velocity-distance relation at H0=73 km/s/Mpc, not
           accounting for a certain Virgocentric flow model.
      h' = by the Hubble velocity-distance relation at H0=73 km/s/Mpc, in view
           of a certain Virgocentric flow model.
     txt = One of a small number of dwarf galaxies (N=11), which are missing
           the measurements of both optical and HI velocities due to their low
           surface brightness and HI deficiency. The texture of these objects
           indicates their likely proximity, which can be verified by future
           observations with HST.
