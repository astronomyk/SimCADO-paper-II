Abstract:
    In this paper we discuss the age and spatial distribution of young
    (age<1Gyr) SMC and LMC clusters using data from the Magellanic Cloud
    Photometric Surveys. Luminosities are calculated for all age-dated
    clusters. Ages of 324 and 1193 populous star clusters in the Small and
    the Large Magellanic Cloud have been determined fitting Padova and
    Geneva isochrone models to their resolved color-magnitude diagrams.
    The clusters cover an age range between 10Myr and 1Gyr in each galaxy.
    For the SMC a constant distance modulus of (m-M)_0_=18.90 and a
    metallicity of Z=0.004 were adopted. For the LMC, we used a constant
    distance modulus of (m-M)_0_=18.50 and a metallicity of Z=0.008.
    For both galaxies, we used a variable color excess to derive the
    cluster ages. We find two periods of enhanced cluster formation in
    both galaxies at 160Myr and 630Myr (SMC) and at 125Myr and 800Myr
    (LMC). We present the spatially resolved recent star formation history
    of both Clouds based on young star clusters. The first peak may have
    been triggered by a close encounter between the SMC and the LMC. In
    both galaxies the youngest clusters reside in the supergiant shells,
    giant shells, the inter-shell regions, and toward regions with a high
    H\alpha content, suggesting that their formation is related to
    expansion and shell-shell interaction. Most of the clusters are older
    than the dynamical age of the supergiant shells. No evidence for
    cluster dissolution was found. Computed V band luminosities show a
    trend for fainter magnitudes with increasing age as well as a trend
    for brighter magnitudes with increasing apparent cluster radii.

Description:
    Ages and luminosities for 324 SMC and 1193 LMC star clusters. For each
    star cluster reddening, radius, log(age(yr)), age uncertainties, right
    ascension, declination, V-band magnitudes, error(V), and
    cross-identification are given.
